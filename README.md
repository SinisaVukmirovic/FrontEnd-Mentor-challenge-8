## My process

### Built with

- ASTRO SSG
- Astro View Transitions

### What I learned

Had so many problems with implementing this type of theme switch functionality into a multipage project like this. Learned that this type of theme switch is suited only for some small langing page projects, for example, not a multipage project...
Had to ommit slider in testimonials section to have it "working"...
Changing pages breaks the functionality of theme switching...
